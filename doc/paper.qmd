# Introduction {#sec-introduction}
The aim of this paper is to illustrate the use of open science tools in empirical accounting research. This project builds on the methodological framework established in the Corporate Decision-Making and Quantitative Analysis (CQA) course, which explored a range of empirical research methods—including archival analysis, field experiments, and survey-based approaches—to develop a comprehensive understanding of corporate decision-making and quantitative analysis. Expanding on prior empirical research conducted in Assignments I and II, this paper extends the empirical focus of the course. Assignment I examined audit market concentration in the EU using Transparency Reports data, offering insights into the dominance of major audit firms and the structure of the European audit market. Assignment II explored the economic implications of corporate financial reporting, focusing on @graham_economic_2005 to analyze managerial decision-making, earnings management strategies, and voluntary disclosure practices.

Building on these foundations, Assignment III investigates the informativeness of quarterly earnings announcements and their contribution to annual share price movements. The project replicates and extends @ball_how_2008, assessing the extent to which earnings releases serve as a source of new information for financial markets. By integrating multiple datasets from WRDS and applying an event-study methodology, this study aims to evaluate the role of earnings disclosures in market efficiency, showcasing the valuation purpose of accounting. At the same time, earnings reports may play a crucial role in contracting by influencing managerial compensation, debt agreements, and other contractual mechanisms tied to financial performance [@ball_how_2008]. The integration of multiple databases adds complexity, requiring a detailed understanding of their structures and careful scripting to extract, align, and analyze data effectively.

Beyond empirical replication, the project also documents research design choices, replication steps, and explicit assumptions made whenever the original paper was unclear on how to proceed. It discusses variations between original and reproduced results and provides insights into the timeliness and market impact of earnings announcements across different timeframes and jurisdictions. Additionally, it sketches a research design for a non-archival study to evaluate the paper’s findings through an alternative methodological lens. This project leverages the TRR 266 Template for Reproducible Empirical Accounting Research (TREAT) to establish an open science-oriented infrastructure, ensuring transparency and replicability for empirical accounting research.

Earnings announcements provide investors with valuable information about a firm’s market value, with stock prices reacting significantly when earnings news deviate from expectations [@fink_review_2021, p.2]. The seminal study by @ball_empirical_1968 was the first to document this relationship, showing that stock prices anticipate earnings surprises, with most of the market reaction occurring before the official announcement, suggesting that earnings reports primarily confirm rather than introduce new information. Over the past decades, more than a thousand studies have examined the interplay between capital markets and financial statements, a research stream that originated with Ball and Brown (1968)  [@kothari_capital_2001].

Building on this foundation, the original study by @ball_how_2008 investigates the extent to which quarterly earnings announcements contribute new information to the market, assessing their role in shaping annual share price movements. By estimating the R² from regressions of annual stock returns on earnings announcement window returns, the paper quantifies the informativeness of earnings releases, finding that they account for only 1% to 2% of total annual volatility. This challenges the assumption that earnings provide substantial new information and instead suggests a confirmatory role in financial reporting. These findings align with the semi-strong form of market efficiency, which suggests that stock prices already reflect all publicly available information, including prior signals about earnings. Unlike traditional event studies that assume market efficiency, @ball_how_2008 allow for potential market mispricing by not imposing a unit slope restriction in their regressions, meaning that their approach can capture under- or overreaction to earnings announcements. They also emphasize that extending the event window beyond the earnings announcement period would shift the research focus from earnings “surprise” to broader financial reporting effects, such as its role in debt contracting and executive compensation.

While @ball_how_2008 provide key insights into the informativeness of earnings announcements, their study was conducted within a specific timeframe and market context. Since then, financial markets have undergone significant changes due to regulatory reforms, economic crises, and technological advancements in financial information processing. Moreover, the extent to which earnings informativeness varies across international markets remains underexplored. By replicating their study with updated data from 2007–2023 and applying the methodology to Canada as a non-U.S. country, this project reassesses the robustness of their findings. Through this approach, it critically evaluates the generalizability of the original results.

The paper is structured into sections corresponding to Tasks 1–3 (@sec-task1, @sec-task2, @sec-task3), each detailing the research design choices and assumptions, documenting the replication steps and results. @sec-task1 follows an exact replication approach by replicating key tables and figures from the original study using US data (1972–2006) to establish baseline results. @sec-task2 extends the analysis through empirical generalization, applying the same methodology to 2007–2023 US data to compare how results evolve over time. @sec-task3 employs a generalization and extension approach by applying the methodology to a non-US country, requiring adjustments for different databases and market structures. This framework aligns with the replication taxonomy outlined by @salterio_replication_2022. Finally, @sec-task4 sketches the survey design as a non-archival study that allows evaluating the key findings of the seminal paper, following Bloomfield’s (2016) triangulation principle. The concluding remarks are provided in @sec-conclusion. 

# Task 1 - Replication of Key Tables and Figures {#sec-task1}
Task 1 is the most comprehensive, replicating the methodology of key tables and figures from @ball_how_2008 using daily US stock return data (1972–2006) to establish baseline results, ensuring alignment with the original findings before extending the analysis in @sec-task2. By reconstructing Table 1 (Panel A), Table 2 (all panels), and Figure 1 (all panels), this task evaluates the robustness of the original results and identifies potential discrepancies, offering insights into data consistency, methodology, and market dynamics over the examined period. The use of daily CRSP data is essential for capturing short-term stock price movements around earnings announcements, ensuring precise event window calculations. The discussion of replication findings is presented in @sec-results1.


## Research Design Choices and Assumptions {#sec-research_design_assumptions1}
Following @ball_how_2008, I focus the analysis on earnings announcements and stock returns from 1972 to 2006, ensuring that the data accurately reflects the original study’s methodology and findings. The replication aims to mirror the research design as closely as possible with the available data, maintaining consistency in sample selection, event window definitions, and return calculations.

Based on the original paper, I do not gather analyst expectations or estimate earnings deviations for my replication. Instead, I only require stock return data and earnings announcement dates, which simplifies the data collection process.

In addition, I impose the following assumptions to ensure clarity and consistency where @ball_how_2008 do not provide explicit guidance:

1. Following @ball_how_2008, I define earnings announcement windows as the three-day period surrounding the earnings release (-1 to +1), where Day -1 is the last trading day before the announcement, Day 0 is the announcement day, and Day +1 is the first trading day after the announcement. According to @center_for_research_in_security_prices_crsp_crsp_2024 guide, data are never provided on weekends or trading holidays, meaning there is no need for manual filtering of such days. However, if an earnings announcement falls on a non-trading day, adjustments are necessary to maintain the three-day window. Hence, earnings announcement dates are first extracted from Compustat and then matched with CRSP trading data to obtain stock returns for the event window (-1, 0, +1). If Day 0 falls on a weekend or holiday, it is shifted to the next available trading day. Similarly, if Day -1 or Day +1 is unavailable due to a non-trading day, the nearest prior or next trading day, respectively, is used to preserve the event window. This adjustment prevents shortening the window, ensuring a complete three-day period for capturing the full market response to earnings announcements.

2. As in the original paper, firm-years are selected based on available stock return data in CRSP. While @ball_how_2008 restrict the sample to firms with at least 240 trading days per year, I follow the course guidance and do not apply this restriction, allowing for a slightly larger sample size. This adjustment should be considered when interpreting differences from the original study.

3. Compustat includes both active and inactive firms, and the original study does not specify filtering based on firm activity. Thus, all firms meeting the sample selection criteria (i.e., four quarterly earnings announcements per year and available stock return data) are retained, regardless of their active status today. 

4. For historical analysis on securities, permanent identifiers, such as `PERMNO`, `PERMCO`, and `GVKEY` are used that never change for the duration of the company’s life span regardless of the name changes and are never being reused [@gow_empirical_2025]. In this replication, variable `PERMNO` is used instead of `PERMCO` because it uniquely identifies individual securities rather than companies, ensuring that stock returns are accurately tracked at the security level. Since firms may have multiple share classes with distinct price movements, using `PERMNO` prevents aggregation issues that could arise with `PERMCO`, which groups all share classes under one identifier.

5. The replication relies on Compustat and CRSP, linked via the CRSP/Compustat Merged (CCM) database, but with different update frequencies: Compustat (daily), CRSP (annually), and CCM (annually). Timing mismatches may arise, especially for firms with restated financials, leading to slight variations in event window alignment when calculating earnings-announcement returns. Unlike the original study, this replication uses the latest WRDS version available as of January 2025, meaning database updates may cause minor differences in firm coverage or reported values.

6. Since @ball_how_2008 analyze returns, I use `RET` variable in CRSP too to simplify the process. Bid and ask prices are ignored. 

7. Same as @ball_how_2008, I group earnings announcements based on their actual announcement dates (`RDQ` from Compustat) rather than the fiscal periods they cover. Since Compustat provides the precise earnings announcement date and CRSP aligns stock returns with trading days (`date` in CRSP), this approach ensures consistency. So, no adjustments are made to realign quarters.

By following the steps outlined in @sec-replication_steps1 and adhering to the assumptions made, I successfully replicated the results from @ball_how_2008. A thorough step-by-step approach, with each step clearly documented, helps to understand and verify the outputs.


## Replication Steps {#sec-replication_steps1}
The analysis involves gathering and filtering stock return and earnings announcement data, linking CRSP stock data with Compustat firm-level accounting data fundamentals, and estimating the relationship between annual returns and earnings-announcement window returns. The replication process follows a structured workflow of data pull, preparation, and analysis, ensuring consistency with the original study.

**Step 1: Pulling the Data and Managing the Databases**  
Data is pulled from the `crsp_a_ccm.ccmxpf_lnkhist`, `crsp_a_stock.dsf`, `comp_na_daily_all.fundq` tables via WRDS, using Python for data processing and regression analysis and facilitating direct access to stock price and return data from CRSP alongside firm fundamentals from Compustat, enabling a seamless link between market and accounting data. Visual Studio Code was used as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, debugging, and optimizing the Python code. While WRDS provides extensive financial datasets, documentation on precise variable selection and dataset integration is limited, requiring additional validation and cross-referencing with prior research.

This Assignment involves pulling data directly from the Audit Analytics database and preparing the data for further analysis from raw data to final output.

To ensure data relevance, the pulling process was restricted to data for the year 2021. The variable `trans_report_auditor_state` was used to filter the data to include only audit firms associated with the specific EU and EEA countries, as specified in configuration file `config/pull_data_cfg​`. This filtering step ensured that the analysis focuses on audit market concentration within the geographical scope and year range as defined by @EC_Report_2024.

**Step 2: Data Preparation**  
The raw Transparency Report dataset initially contained 13,385 observations, representing entries for the year 2021. To ensure consistency with @EC_Report_2024, the abbreviation 'GR' for Greece was replaced with 'EL' in the trans_report_auditor_state field, affecting 188 rows.

The `number_of_disclosed_pies` variable provides the clearest indication of statutory audits conducted by each auditor for PIEs. The definition of PIEs varies across EU and EEA countries [@AccountancyEurope_PIE_2017], but if Transparency Reports consistently follow country-specific definitions, using the provided variable is reasonable. An important verification step involved comparing the reported `number_of_disclosed_pies` with the count of unique `entity_map_fkey` entries for each `transparency_report_fkey`. This analysis revealed that 5,696 transparency reports included fewer entities in the dataset than the disclosed PIEs, suggesting that some PIE entities might be missing from the dataset. This discrepancy reflects missing PIE data rather than the inclusion of non-PIE entities, hence it is assumed that all entities in the dataset are PIEs, maintaining consistency in the framework for analysis.

Additionally, missing values in key fields, including `transparency_report_fkey`, `entity_map_fkey`, `auditor_fkey`, and `trans_report_auditor_state`, were checked, and it was confirmed that no rows needed to be removed due to missing data, ensuring the completeness of the dataset. To focus on relevant data, rows with `number_of_disclosed_pies` equal to or less than zero were filtered, but no such rows were identified, and all observations were retained. 

Duplicate entries in the `entity_map_fkey` column were then analyzed, revealing 1,011 duplicate entities. I assume that duplicate entries in the dataset do not introduce significant issues for the replication of Figure 3. Duplicate entries for the same entity are expected in cases where an entity is audited by multiple audit firms or networks, potentially as part of a joint audit. Since these duplicates retain consistent information on `trans_report_auditor_state`, they do not distort country-level distributions. Additionally, while duplicates might expand representation across different auditor networks or groups, the essence of Figure 3 — focusing on aggregate distributions — remains unaffected. Therefore, these duplicates were not removed. 

Auditor network names were standardized to ensure consistency, with names like `|Mazars Worldwide|Praxity Global Alliance|` simplified to `|Mazars Worldwide|`, for example. This standardization helped avoid double-counting and unify same entries under consistent naming conventions.

Audit firms were then categorized into groups, including the Big 4 (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC), the 10KAP (which includes the Big 4 along with other major networks listed in @sec-research_design_assumptions), 'Unaffiliated' firms (those outside the Big 4 and 10KAP). The `auditor_network` field contained 636 observations with missing values, which were grouped under the “Other (Blank)” category. I assume that these blank entries do not belong to the Big Four or 10KAP networks but may still contribute to the CR4 category in some countries. So, these entries were retained in the dataset and reviewed during the aggregation stage to validate their relevance. 

These preparation steps ensured alignment with the methodology of @EC_Report_2024 and the dataset’s readiness for subsequent analysis.

**Step 3: Analysis Implementation and Reproduction of Tables and Figure**  
The analysis step computes market concentration metrics for audit firms across EU countries and at the EU level using the prepared transparency data. The analysis begins by calculating the market shares of the Big 4, 10KAP, and CR4 audit firm groups for the number of statutory audits conducted in 2021. For each country, the Big 4 market share is derived as the percentage of PIE statutory audits conducted by Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC, while the CR4 market share represents the top four audit firms in each country based on audit counts. The 10KAP market share includes the Big 4 along with six additional networks, providing a broader view of market concentration.

Since @ball_how_2008 do not explicitly describe their return computation, I compute Buy-and-Hold Returns (BHR) following the cumulative return formula as discussed in @gundersen_returns_2022. The BHR formula captures compounded returns over multiple days, reflecting the stock’s actual performance.

The following formula is used to calculate market share:
$$
\text{Market Share (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of PIE Audits by Network Group}}{\text{Total PIE Audits in Country}} \right) \times 100
$$

The analysis also includes the creation of a bar chart visualizing market shares for all countries and the EU aggregate, saved in both PNG and pickle formats. The aggregated market share data is saved in CSV format, ensuring reproducibility and further analysis opportunities.


## Results {#sec-results1}
Comparing the replication results of Figure 1 (see @fig-market-shares) with those from @ball_how_2008 (see @fig-fig1_original) reveals both similarities and discrepancies.

@fig-market-shares illustrates the... Countries are sorted in a specific order reflecting the replication of Figure 3 from the European Commission’s 2024 report. 

To verify the results of analysis step and observe trends before plotting, I have additionally saved the CSV output in `aggregated_market_shares.csv`. The analysis of market shares for statutory audits across European countries reveals distinct patterns of market concentration and auditor dominance. Big 4 firms exhibit a significant presence, often commanding a dominant share in many countries. For example, countries such as the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Finland demonstrate Big 4 market shares exceeding 95%, reflecting the significant influence of these firms in specific markets. However, the extent of this dominance varies, with lower Big 4 shares observed in countries like Bulgaria (17.5%) and Greece (43.6%), indicating a more diversified audit market in these regions. The analysis reveals that the Big 4 hold a market share exceeding 80% in 11 EU countries. This aligns with rthe finding of @EC_Report_2024, which similarly highlights that the Big 4 dominate over 80% of the market share in 11 Member States.

The inclusion of additional audit networks through the 10KAP grouping increases the market share substantially across all countries, as expected. This is particularly evident in countries like Ireland, Malta, and the Netherlands, where the 10KAP share reaches 100%, reflecting the full inclusion of statutory audits under this grouping. In contrast, countries like Bulgaria and Poland, with 10KAP shares of 41.8% and 63.6%, respectively, suggest the presence of a substantial number of statutory audits conducted by unaffiliated or smaller firms.

In the analysis of CR4 market shares, I verified whether the four largest audit firms (CR4) in each country overlapped entirely with the Big 4 audit firms. This overlap occurred in 15 out of 28 countries, where CR4 and Big 4 market shares were identical. In the remaining 13 countries, at least one non-Big 4 firm contributed significantly to the statutory audits, resulting in distinct CR4 market shares. These findings align with @EC_Report_2024, which notes that in 13 Member States, the Big Four are not the four largest audit firms in terms of the total number of PIE statutory audit opinions. This highlights the gradual diversification in the audit market in some countries, where non-Big 4 firms are playing a more prominent role, while the Big 4 continue to dominate in others.

At the EU level, the aggregated market shares further underscore the dominance of these major players. The Big 4 account for 70% of statutory audits, compared to @EC_Report_2024, which notes an average EU market share of 59% for the Big 4 in 2021, down from 70% in 2018. The broader 10KAP grouping in my output reaches nearly 90%, exceeding the 81% reported by @EC_Report_2024. The CR4 market share at the EU level also stands at 70%, aligning with the Big 4, and is consistent with the average CR4 market share reported by @EC_Report_2024. These results highlight the varying degrees of market concentration across Europe, with certain countries demonstrating a highly centralized audit market dominated by the Big 4, while others display a more distributed market landscape, incorporating both major and smaller audit firms. The slight discrepancies in the figures suggest potential differences in methodologies, data coverage, or sample definitions.

Based on the results for Austria, the Big 4 market share is 86.7% in my analysis, aligning closely with the approximate 85% represented in bar chart of @EC_Report_2024. Similarly, the 10KAP market share of 92.55% in my analysis corresponds well with the slightly higher bar in the report, and the CR4 market share of 86.7% aligns perfectly with the Big 4 share, confirming the dominance of these firms in Austria’s audit market. This consistency highlights the robustness of the replicated analysis for this country.

The results for Romania show notable discrepancies. The EC Report indicates market shares of 15% for the Big 4, 16% for CR4, and 24% for 10KAP, while my analysis reports significantly higher values: 63%, 70.61%, and 78.38%, respectively. These differences likely arise from assumptions made in @sec-research_design_assumptions like variations in PIE definitions and auditor classifications. The report by @EC_Report_2024 may use stricter criteria, reflecting Romania’s decentralized market where non-Big 4 firms dominate, unlike the broader inclusion in my dataset. 

In summary, the replication effectively captures the original report's key findings, confirming the dominance of the Big 4 and the broader 10KAP group in the European audit market. The analysis highlights varying degrees of market concentration across countries, with some demonstrating a more decentralized audit landscape. While discrepancies in individual country results, such as Romania, underline the importance of methodological alignment, the strong similarity between the overall market shares reported in the original report and the replicated results underscores the robustness and reliability of the findings.
qqq we confirm? "The results are consistent with the view that the primary economic role of reported earnings is not to provide timely new information to the share market. By inference, that role lies elsewhere, for example, in settling debt and compensation contracts and in disciplining prior information,including more timely managerial disclosures of information originating in the firm’s accounting system. The comparatively low “surprise” content of earnings announcements is to be expected, for a variety of reasons. By its nature, accounting earnings is low frequency (quarterly), not discretionary (announced every quarter, independent of whether there is substantial new information to report), and primarily backward-looking. Other information, and hence revision in share price, is comparatively high frequency, frequently discretionary (released only when there is substantial information to report), and both forward-looking and backward-looking."

# Task 2 - Extending the Analysis to 2007–2023 {#sec-task2}
This Section extends the analysis to 2007–2023, a period defined by major economic events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced the informativeness of earnings announcements. While the task is relatively straightforward in terms of programming—requiring adjustments to the sample period—it demands careful economic interpretation of observed trends, market shifts, and potential institutional details that may influence the relationship between earnings announcements and stock returns.

## Research Design Choices and Assumptions {#sec-research_design_assumptions2}

Assumptions from @sec-research_design_assumptions1 still hold. 

## Replication Steps {#sec-replication_steps2}
## Results {#sec-results2}

# Task 3 - Cross-Country Replication {#sec-task3}
Task 3 extends the analysis beyond the United States by replicating Figure 1 using 1972-2023 data (if entire data range pull possible) from a non-U.S. market, providing insights into how earnings informativeness varies across different regulatory environments and market structures. This task requires mapping variables from CRSP/Compustat to their equivalents in Worldscope/Datastream, adjusting for differences in accounting standards, market liquidity, and institutional factors. Worldscope (Thomson/Refinitiv) serves as the international alternative of Compustat for earnings announcement data, while Datastream provides stock market data for non-U.S. companies. While the core replication methodology remains the same, careful data handling and economic interpretation are crucial to account for cross-country analysis with Canada.

## Research Design Choices and Assumptions {#sec-research_design_assumptions3}
Since this task employs a generalization and extension approach by applying the same methodology to a country different from original report, it requires adjustments for different databases and market structures. Based on the original paper, I do not gather analyst expectations or estimate earnings deviations for my replication. Instead, I only require stock return data and earnings announcement dates.

Canada as the country of choice was influenced by the alignment with the methodology of @ball_how_2008, where the key factor in the selection was the availability of quarterly earnings reports, which ensures comparability with U.S. data. For Canada, the reporting frequency is majority 4x, with some 2x, similar to the US [@short_short_2025]. While Canada has a smaller market size than the U.S., its regulatory environment, reporting frequency, and institutional settings are highly comparable, making it an optimal choice for the non-U.S. analysis. Additionally, Canada features a developed capital market with high trading volume and liquidity, ensuring that stock price reactions to earnings announcements are observable in the replication. A further advantage is that Canadian firms registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can report under U.S. GAAP, making their financial disclosures fully compatible with U.S. firms. This reduces methodological differences to the original study. 

In addition, I impose the following assumptions apart from those listed in @sec-research_design_assumptions1 to ensure generalization and extension approach due to usage of other databases or where @ball_how_2008 do not provide explicit guidance:

1. To ensure a smooth and conflict-free process, I handle the WSCP/Datastream workflow separately, preventing potential interference with the CRSP/Compustat pull process and improving debugging efficiency. Although a unified pull/prepare/do_analysis file for all databases would be ideal and streamline management, the large-scale nature of the extracted datasets demands modular approach. Therefore, I isolate the workflow for @sec-task3 into working files `...-wscp`, thus reducing complicated dependencies across tasks.

2. Since I do not perform subgroup analysis for December and non-December fiscal year end firms as in Table 2 Panels C-D, `item5350` for FISCAL PERIOD END DATE is not relevant for this task, as Figure 1 applies to the analysis of the entire dataset. So, the sample is all firm-years with available data on the quarterly Worlscope and daily Datastream files.

3. I verified whether Worldscope and Datastream follow the same earnings announcement date convention as Compustat or if they report earnings based on fiscal periods. I decided to use Worldscope items 5901–5904 from historical stock-related data in `wrds_ws_stock`, which represent the actual date when a company publicly reports its earnings for each quarter, where, however, data for these fields is generally not available prior to 1992. [@thomson_financial_worldscope_2007, p.281]. This may cause limited data sample size. 

4. This task is a generalization to a non-U.S. setting, meaning methodological differences will certainly arise due to variations in data structure and reporting standards. Worldscope - Stock Data `wrds_ws_stock` table is updated quarterly, while Datastream Daily Stock File `wrds_ds2dsf` is updated weekly, which may introduce timing mismatches when aligning financial fundamentals with stock returns. Given that, future applications should consider database updates and coverage differences between CRSP and Datastream.

5. Similar to @sec-task1, I use returns `ret` variable in Datastream to simplify the process, presented as percentage change. Bid and ask prices are ignored. 

6. I ignore the currency effect (CAD or USD) in DS table, as returns are measured in percentages, making them relative rather than absolute values.


## Replication Steps {#sec-replication_steps3}
Same as in @sec-task1 the analysis involves gathering and filtering stock return and earnings announcement data, linking Datastream stock data with WSCP (Worldscope), and estimating the relationship between annual returns and earnings-announcement window returns. The replication process follows a structured workflow of data pull, preparation, and analysis, ensuring consistency with the original study.

**Step 1: Pulling the Data and Managing the Databases**  
I follow the linking approach between Worldscope and Datastream based on @dai_research_2021. The original study uses data from 1972 onward, while Worldscope's `year_` variable only provides data starting from 1980 [@wharton_research_data_services_worldscope_2025]. This constraint may lead to differences in sample coverage. Hence, filter Datastream `marketdate` to 1980 to prevent mismatched observations where stock data exists but earnings do not. 

The data pull step retrieves quarterly earnings announcement dates from Worldscope and daily stock returns from Datastream, filtering for Canadian firms from 1980 onward. The datasets are saved separately and later merged using firm-level identifiers. Only common equity (`typecode` = EQ) is included to ensure consistency with CRSP. 

The pull step results into three comprehensive datasets: DS table with 27,950,012, Link table with 77,944, WSCP table with 1,942,202 observations.

**Step 2: Data Preparation**  
First, I merged Worldscope stock data with the linking table using `code` as unique identifier, resulting in 747,760 observations. This merged dataset was then joined with Datastream daily stock data using unique `infocode`, producing a final dataset with 10,249,737 observations.

If a firm had missing values for any of the Earnings Per Share Report Date fields (item5901–item5904), it did not meet the criteria set by @ball_how_2008 and was excluded from the sample. This filtering step removed 3,609,492 missing firm-year observations. Additionally, 5,996,793 firm-year entries were dropped because their four earnings announcements did not fall within the same calendar year. The final dataset consists of only 616,980 valid firm-year observations, starting in 1996 only, signaling the potential difference in the accounting reporting standards between the U.S. and Canada.

Notably, after pulling the annual stock data for further annual return calculation, all infocodes present an average of 250 trading days, highlighting full year stock coverage.

**Step 3: Analysis Implementation and Reproduction of Tables and Figure**

# Task 4 - Research Design for a Non-Archival Study {#sec-task4}

The research design follows the generalization goal in empirical literature, emphasizing the need to validate findings across different methods [@bloomfield_gathering_2016]. @ball_how_2008 assess earnings informativeness through stock price reactions, but triangulation—beyond replication—requires diverse methods to examine the same question [@bloomfield_gathering_2016, p.353]. While price reactions indicate market response, they do not capture investor perceptions. A survey directly evaluates whether market participants view earnings announcements as confirmatory or informative. If investors confirm a secondary role, it reinforces Ball and Shivakumar’s (2008) findings, ensuring informativeness reflects cognitive and behavioral mechanisms rather than price fluctuations. These insights could inform corporate reporting strategies by clarifying how investors prioritize disclosures.

A survey is the most suitable non-archival method, capturing investor sentiment beyond what archival data provides. Unlike lab experiments, which lack real-world applicability, surveys measure the dependent variable (DV) by eliciting participant perceptions [@bloomfield_gathering_2016, p.358]. Field experiments, though capturing real-time reactions, require direct intervention, posing ethical and logistical challenges. A long-term research program combining surveys and field studies would enhance validity, leveraging unlimited funds to assess investor decision-making and market responses.

To ensure survey reliability, design strategies follow @bruggemann_worku_2024. A sample of 300 investors, analysts, and financial professionals will provide institutional and retail perspectives while balancing statistical power and feasibility. The survey will be distributed via email through financial networks, investor associations, and professional platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, CFA societies) and in paper format at finance conferences. The Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (HU) brand may be used, subject to approval. Respondents will be assured confidentiality and offered an €20 honorarium. A pilot study with 30 participants will refine question clarity, survey length, and response distribution, helping identify unclear or missing questions and assess completion time.

To minimize response bias, questions will be neutrally worded to capture pre- and post-announcement perceptions. The fully anonymous survey ensures candid responses without requiring personal financial history.

The **DV** is the perceived informativeness of earnings announcements, measured through survey responses on whether they are confirmatory or informative. Independent variables (**IVs**) include investor preparation, market awareness, reaction timing, perceived novelty of earnings, key financial indicators, and external conditions. These are measured via Likert-scale, ranking, and multiple-choice questions, supplemented by qualitative insights from follow-up interviews.

To deepen findings, selected participants will be invited for confidential follow-up interviews, ensuring diversity in investment strategies, industries, and expertise. These interviews will be conducted via video conferencing or phone calls. The following sections provide detailed sketches of the survey and interview designs.

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}
This project effectively demonstrates the use of a systematic and collaborative workflow for empirical accounting research, leveraging the TRR 266 Template for Reproducible Empirical Accounting Research. By following an open science approach, I successfully replicated key tables and figures from @ball_how_2008, providing insights into how earnings announcements contribute to price formation and market efficiency. While exact replications often yield different samples and outcomes due to dataset updates or methodological variations, my results align closely with the statistics presented in the original study, reinforcing the reliability of the replication process. Moreover, by extending the analysis beyond the original study’s U.S. market focus, the project highlights how market structures and investor behaviors influence the informativeness of earnings disclosures in different jurisdictions.

The study contributes to the ongoing discussion on market efficiency and the economic role of corporate disclosures by providing empirical evidence on how earnings informativeness has evolved over time and across jurisdictions. The cross-country analysis with Canada highlights variations in market responses to earnings announcements, suggesting that institutional factors, market structures, and investor behavior play a role in shaping how financial information is processed. These findings have implications for investors, analysts, and policymakers, as they underscore the importance of regulatory consistency and market transparency in shaping the effectiveness of financial reporting.

This assignment required a comprehensive application of programming skills and institutional knowledge gained throughout the course, integrating data analysis, replication, and visualization techniques in line with open science principles. In the future, this repository can be cloned or forked (if made public) to facilitate further research on earnings informativeness, enabling additional extensions or robustness tests. Additionally, the survey developed as part of the non-archival study proposal can be further refined and expanded, providing a structured framework for gathering primary data on market participants’ interpretations of earnings announcements. Through this approach, the study not only revisits a fundamental question in financial research but also provides a foundation for future empirical investigations into the evolving role of earnings announcements in global capital markets, both through archival and non-archival methodologies.
